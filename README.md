# [JSL05] Submission: Galaxy Playlist Generator


#### Instructions:

1. **Expand the Songs Array**: Add at least five songs to the `songs` array, each with `title`, `artist`, and `genre`.
2. **Assign Preferences**: Complete the `guardians` object by assigning each Guardian their preferred music genre.
3. **Generate Playlists**: Implement the `generatePlaylist` function. Use the `map()` function to create a personalized playlist for each Guardian based on their genre preference.
4. **Display Playlists**: Dynamically create and append elements to the `#playlists` div to display each Guardian's playlist. Include the Guardian's name and their list of songs.
5. **Test Your Application**: Ensure that your application correctly filters songs by genre for each Guardian and displays the playlists on the web page.

## What You Need to Do:

1. Clone the provided Starter Code Repository to your local development environment (e.g., VSCode): https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/Module_5_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSL05
2. Open the cloned project in your code editor.
3. Code your solution for each of the challenges as per the provided instructions.
4. Commit your changes to your local Git repository with meaningful commit messages.
5. Push your local Git repository to your GitHub account.
6. Verify that the changes have been successfully pushed to your GitHub repository.

## What You Need to Include:

1. Ensure that your code includes the necessary modifications to meet the challenge requirements.
2. Your GitHub repository should contain the updated code files.



# Project Overview
In this challenge, you'll combine your knowledge of JavaScript arrays and the `map()` function to create a personalized "Awesome Mix" playlist for each of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Your task is to filter and organize songs based on each Guardian's musical preference, displaying a playlist tailored just for them.

# Project Brief
I had to work with the Monster Ternary Operator. I had to use ternary operators to make decisions based on various scenarios involving Monster Energy drinks. The ternary operator must decide between two options based on a condition, demonstrating its utility for concise conditional logic. While ternaries can make the code succinct, they should be used judiciously to maintain readability.

# Elements included 
- Ensuring that my code includes the necessary modifications to meet the challenge requirements.
- My GitHub repository should contain the updated code files.

# Reflections 

### Areas of mastery 
The ternary operater structure feels very comfortable to me after having completed the challenges and gone through the content. I believe that I have mastered the ternary operators. 

### Challenges faced 
Not many challenges faced in this project, I was able to obtain the desired result with the solutionn I provided. 

### Areas of Improvement 
An area of improvement that I would like to focus on, especially on future projects (which will require more), is finding better ways to write more elegant lines of code that reduce clutter and unnecessary lines of code. These operators showed me that it is possible, I would like to, however, find more succint solutions.

## Overall learning experience
My overall experience was quite positive, as I was able to adjust easier to operators in the JavaScript language and was comfortable enough with them that I understood how to code a solution.
