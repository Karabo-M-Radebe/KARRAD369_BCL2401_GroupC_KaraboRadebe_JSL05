# [JSL05] Submission: Galaxy Playlist Generator


# Project Overview
In this challenge, you'll combine your knowledge of JavaScript arrays and the `map()` function to create a personalized "Awesome Mix" playlist for each of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Your task is to filter and organize songs based on each Guardian's musical preference, displaying a playlist tailored just for them.

# Project Brief
In this project, I had to work with the map() functions in order to create a playlist generator based on genres of the songs. Using this function, along with the filter() function I had to assign preferences and generate a playlist. Then the next object was to display the playlist by appending certain elements.

# Elements included 
- Ensuring that my code includes the necessary modifications to meet the challenge requirements.
- My GitHub repository should contain the updated code files.

# Reflections 

### Areas of mastery 
Throughout this project, there were many new things I learnt and most of them are still a bit confusing to me, which is why I believe there are no areas of mastery regarding the map() function as an array method.

### Challenges faced 
Throughout this project, there were many challenges that I faced, most of them being debugging issues. One major issue I faced during the process was figuring out the proper syntax for a map() function, this challenge set me back a long while as I tried to find a solution. Another big challenge I faced a was when I wanted to display the playlist, and simply could not figure out how to code a solution that fits.  

### Areas of Improvement 
An area of improvement that could help me in future as I focused more on it would be naming my functions in a clearer way that aligns with what the code does (making it more descriptive). I believe another area of improvement would be figuring out the neccessary extensions to add to my VScode that would elevate my coding experience, an example of this would be Quokka. Another area of improvement would be the manner in which my comments are utilised to convey competence and ease of collaboration. 

## Overall learning experience
My overall experience was not much of a positive nature , even though I was able to eventually adjust, I still leave the project without much of a positive experience. I think having to learn and apply such a skill, followed by a project submission took a bit of a toll on me for the week, and that affected my performance.
